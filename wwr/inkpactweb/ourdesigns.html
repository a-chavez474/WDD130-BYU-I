                <h2>Designs that are easy to read and find</h2>
                <p>We take your ideas and turn them into a pretty mockup that shows what your future website will look like focusing on how your layout design impacts your users. For example, weâ€™ll help you decide where to put buttons to get more people to click them, or how to structure your navigation to make your site flow as seamlessly as possible.

                <h2>Accessible to everyone in the planet</h2>
                <p>We'll make content updates dynamically. This includes screen overlays, lightboxes, in-page updates, popups, and modal dialogs. Avoinding Keyboard-only users not to get trapped in page overlays. These functions can easily be made accessible. Options include ARIA roles and alerts, as well as front-end development frameworks that specifically support accessibility. Ensuring that video players do not auto-play, and that the players can be used with a keyboard. Additionally, all videos must have options for closed captioning and transcripts for the hearing-impaired. If the website contains a slideshow, we'll make sure that each photo has alt text and can be navigated via the keyboard.
