    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Abel and I'm working to get my certification in web design.</p>
    <p>I'm a graphic designer by profession. I love fishing and the outdoors, good food and
        spend time with my grandkids.</p>
    <p>At the moment I'm working in a small company as a graphic
        designer and I'm getting ready to find an intership in coding or in web designer.</p>
    <p>I love Byu-i online classes and I'm so grateful for the opportunity to improved my skills.</p>
    <p>I have converted to the Church of Jesus Christ in my 19's, served a mission in Peru, got married to my wonderful
        wife.</p>
    <p>My favorite scripture is 2Nephi 33:12 </p>
